# Mobile Tech Task
A simple finance based Flutter app that contains lists or re-orderable credit card details A full-size featured card is also available. When we click the credit card, we are taken to the simple details page. I had implemented horizontal scrolling with multiple tab bars, and vertical lists are just as dismissable.
